To generalise the gaussian copula model to other copulas, I considered a D-vine copula model where the joint distribution is factorised is follows:
	-> the f's are the marginal densities and c's are marginal or conditional copula densities
the marginal densities for the observed data, so the bivariate density for the treated or control group directly follows from this D-vine copula
this is very similar to the gaussian copula:
	-> in the gaussian copula, two out of the six correlations were identifiable
	-> now, two out of the six copulas are identifiable
	-> and as was done for the four unidentifiable correlations in the gaussian copula model, the four unidentifiable copulas are part of the sensitivity analysis
Moreover, if all six copulas are bivariate gaussian copulas, then this d-vine copula is equivalent to the gaussian copula model I considered previously
	-> so this D-vine copula model really is more general than the gaussian copula model

Looked at three copula models: so the gaussian copula, clayton copula and frank copula
	-> for every copula model, I considered both models that do and do not take into account the time orderings.
