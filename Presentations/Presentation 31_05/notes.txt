slide3:
	these histograms are each based on 1000 replications of the sensitivty analyses with different assumptions on the unidentifiable associations
	as presented some time ago, taking time orderings into account is beneficial in terms of more peaked histograms
	
	the monotonicity assumption results in wider histograms, whereas the weaker cross-association assumption results in more peaked histograms
	in this case, I think both assumptions are realistic

slide4:
	An alternative to making these assumptions is to plot the surrogacy measures against unidentifiable quantitiaties
	such as the average cross-association in terms of kendall's tau
		so clearly, as the average cross-association increases, the surrogacy measure tends to decrease

slide5: 
	just the histograms summarised here

slide6:
	better to use a grid?


sampling is fine
colorectal, where to get?
	-> even more than one
	-> tomasz, Buyse, ibiostat?
	
marc might also have ideas about other data sets
